Historical
----------

Code was originally designed and implemented for the successful, but now defunct plone.net.
Plone.net was folded back in to plone.org at the Cioppino Sprint in early 2011::

    This software is designed for the future plone.net. As such, while
    others are welcome to them, they are not neccessarily intended for
    public consumption.  We welcome bug fixes, but please refrain from
    adding new features without talking with the developers first.

    Vision
    ------

    plone.org currently mixes community and commercial announcements.
    During the last year the policy has gotten strict about not doing
    commercial postings.  However, we need a place for providing business
    information to decision-makers.

    This is the vision for plone.net: "All the business information,
    attractive and organized, for decision-makers."  We want to collect
    case studies, solution providers, mentions in the press, training
    announcements, books and articles, etc.  And, we want to present this
    information in a well-organized fashion.  Finally, we want a strong
    editorial process to ensure we don't have 500 companies claiming to be
    the galaxy's leading Plone company. :^)

    Additionally, we want the Plone Foundation to have a revenue stream.
    For example, we need to start exhibiting at conferences, to make sure
    we win "Best of Show", to make sure we're always considered the
    leaders.  We plan to do the solution provider directory in a way where
    companies that sponsor the foundation get a better listing, just like
    the Pages Jaunes.
